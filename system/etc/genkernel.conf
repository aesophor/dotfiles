# Configuration file for genkernel

# This file is sourced by genkernel at startup and determines which options
# we will be using to compile our kernel.  The order of precidence is simple,
# with the internal settings being least important, configuration file
# settings next, and command line options being most important.

# =========Common Command Line Option Defaults=========

# Should we install to $BOOTDIR?  Default is "no" because genkernel is used in
# catalyst and stage building.
INSTALL="yes"

# Run 'make oldconfig' before compiling this kernel?
OLDCONFIG="yes"

# Run 'make menuconfig' before compiling this kernel?
MENUCONFIG="yes"

# Run 'make nconfig' (ncurses 'menuconfig') before compiling this kernel?
NCONFIG="no"

# Note, that two previous lines are mutual exclusive (logically), while
# MENUCONFIG has a higher priority if both them is enabled.

# Run 'make clean' before compilation?
# If set to NO, implies MRPROPER WILL NOT be run
# Also, if clean is NO, it won't copy over any configuration
# file, it will use what's there.
CLEAN="yes"

# Run 'make mrproper' before configuration/compilation?
MRPROPER="no"

# Override the arch detection?
#ARCH_OVERRIDE="x86"

# Mount BOOTDIR automatically if it isn't mounted?
MOUNTBOOT="no"

# Make symlinks in BOOTDIR automatically?
#SYMLINK="no"

# Save the new configuration in /etc/kernels upon
# successfull compilation
SAVE_CONFIG="yes"

# Use Color output in Genkernel?
USECOLOR="yes"

# Clear build cache dir
#CLEAR_CACHE_DIR="yes"

# Clear all tmp files and caches after genkernel has run
#POSTCLEAR="1"

# Genkernel uses an independent configuration for MAKEOPTS, and does not source
# /etc/make.conf . You can override the default setting by uncommenting and
# tweaking the following line. Default setting is set up by
# ${GK_SHARE}/${ARCH_OVERRIDE}/config.sh . The recommended value for -j
# argument is: <number of processors>*<number of cores per processor>+1
MAKEOPTS="-j9"

# Add in LVM support from static binaries if they exist on the system, or
# compile static LVM binaries if static ones do not exist.
LVM="yes"

# Add in Luks support. Needs sys-fs/cryptsetup with -dynamic installed.
LUKS="yes"

# Add in GnuPG support
GPG="no"

# Add DMRAID support.
DMRAID="no"

# Include (or suppresses the inclusion of) busybox in the initrd or initramfs.
# If included, busybox is rebuilt if the cached copy is out of date.
#BUSYBOX="yes"

# Use udev instead of mdev as the default device manager for the initramfs.
# If you use systemd and perhaps lvm, you _must_ keep this turned on.
UDEV="yes"

# Includes mdadm/mdmon binaries in initramfs.
# Without sys-fs/mdadm[static] installed, this will build a static mdadm.
MDADM="no"

# Specify a custom mdadm.conf.
# By default the ramdisk will be built *without* an mdadm.conf and will auto-detect
# arrays during bootup.  Usually, this should not be needed.
#MDADM_CONFIG="/etc/mdadm.conf"

# Add Multipath support.
#MULTIPATH="no"

# Add iSCSI support.
ISCSI="no"

# Add e2fsprogs support.
E2FSPROGS="no"

# Enable copying of firmware into initramfs
FIRMWARE="no"
# Specify directory to pull from
FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"
# Specify specific firmware files to include. This overrides FIRMWARE_DIR
#FIRMWARE_FILES=""

# Add new kernel to grub?
#BOOTLOADER="grub"

# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
#SPLASH="yes"

# Use this splash theme. If commented out - the "default" name theme is used.
# Also, SPLASH="yes" needs to be enabled for this one to one work.
# This supersedes the "SPLASH_THEME" option of /etc/conf.d/splash (in early space).
#SPLASH_THEME="gentoo"

# Installs, or not, plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed at boot, plymouth will be activated.
# PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given plymouth theme into the initramfs.
# PLYMOUTH_THEME="text"

# NOTE: Since genkernel 3.4.41 the version of
#   busybox, lvm, mdadm, .. have been moved to
#   /usr/share/genkernel/defaults/software.sh in order to
#   reduce the merging you have to do during etc-update.
#   You can still override these settings in here.
